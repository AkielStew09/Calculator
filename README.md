Project Calculator from TheOdinProject

This is apparently the final project for the foundation section of TheOdinProject. I'm a lot more
interested in learning full stack technology, which is why I at first considered skipping this, 
but I decided against it. I don't want to spend too much time on front end development, since
 I'd prefer to study the more web focused and server focused aspects of development as well
 as working with API's, but I figured it would make sense to at least give this a try, as more
projects under my belt will only make me a better coder, which is of course useful no matter 
what area of coding I'm more interested in. So I don't think I'll fully commit to this or maybe 
even finish it, but I'll do it simply because why not.
